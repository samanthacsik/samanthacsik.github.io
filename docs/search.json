    "text": "III. Adding a blog to your personal Quarto website\nTL;DR: A couple of steps are required for setting up your blog, but generally speaking, you’ll need:\nangle-right a folder (i.e. subdirectory) to hold all of your individual blog posts – I called my folder posts (though the name is up to you). I also (optionally) added a _metadata.yml file to this folder which includes some formatting and configuration options that will apply to all blog posts in this folder\nangle-right a listing page, which lists all of your blog posts for viewers to browse and click through – this is a .qmd file that you’ll add to your website’s navbar by including it in _quarto.yml\nangle-right blog posts! Your listing page will be blank until you actually add your first blog post\nLet’s create those together now.\n\nCreate a /posts folder: Open up your Quarto website project (I find it easiest to do this in RStudio) and make sure you’re in your root directory. Here, we’ll create a new subdirectory, called posts (you can call this whatever you want), where all of our blog posts will eventually live. To do so, you can either (a) click on the add folder button, , in the Files pane, or (b) in the RStudio Terminal, run mkdir posts.\nOptional: Add a _metadata.yml file to /posts: While not required, a _metadata.yml file can make your life easier if you want certain options to apply to all blog posts that you create. In the RStudio Terminal, run cd posts to move into that directory, then touch _metadata.yml to create the file. Open your _metadata.yml in the Source pane to add options. I like these options2, but it’s entirely up to you what you want to include (if anything at all):\n\n\n# options specified here will apply to all posts in this folder\n\n# prevents posts from re-rendering unless explicitly told to do so (for more, see https://quarto.org/docs/projects/code-execution.html#freeze)\nfreeze: true\n\n# enable banner style title blocks (see https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/title-blocks.html)\ntitle-block-banner: true\n\n\nCreate a listing page: A listing page is a page with content that is automatically generated from a list of documents – in this case, that would be a list of blog posts – and looks something like this (or check out my blog’s listing page here):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe MEDS Community Blog listing page, with multiple blog posts arranged in the default-style layout – Quarto has multiple listing page layout options (default, grid, table) for you to explore\n\n\n\n\n\nTo create a listing page, add a posts.qmd file to your root directory. First, click on the R Project icon, , in the Files pane to jump back to your project’s root directory. There are a bunch of ways to create a new .qmd file, but one easy way is to choose File &gt; New File &gt; Quarto Document…. Below, I give mine the title “My Blog” when prompted (this name appears at the top of your listing page), then saved it as posts.qmd (but you can choose whatever title and/or file name you’d like).\n\n\nConfigure your listing page: Specify how you’d like your listing page to be arranged by updating the YAML section of posts.qmd. There are a variety of options that you can specify. Below are just a few, but check out other options here:\n\n\ntitle: \"My Blog\"\nlisting: \n  contents: posts # all Quarto docs in the `posts` directory will be included on your listing page\n  type: grid # or `default` or `table`; each type has its own set of yaml options to include\n  sort: \"date desc\" # can also sort on more than one field\n  categories: true # allows you to sort posts by assigned categories \n\n\nAdd your listing page to your website’s navbar: Update _quarto.yml with your new listing page to add it to your site’s navbar:\n\n\n# ~ parts of `_quarto.yml` omitted for brevity ~\n\nwebsite:\n  navbar:\n    title: myWebsiteTitle\n    right:\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: home\n      - about.qmd\n      - posts.qmd # add your posts.qmd file to your navbar!\n\n\nPreview or Render your website: Make sure your listing page shows up by previewing or rendering your website (you can do either of these from the Build tab in RStudio. You should have something that looks like this (we haven’t created any posts yet, so it’ll be empty for now):"

Both of these fields will appear on your listing page.\nYou can include more than one author – see this post and source code as an example.\nYou may include as many self-defined categories as you’d like. Make sure that your spelling/capitalization/punctuation is consistent across blog posts should you apply the same categories to multiple posts.\nAdding the citation option automatically generates both a BibTeX citation and reference for your blog post, and adds them to the bottom of your post.\nInclude an image (or gif) to add as a preview image, which will appear on your listing page alongside your post. Your image should live inside your post’s subdirectory (e.g. mywebsite/posts/2022-10-24-my-blog-post/preview-image.png).\nSet draft: true while you’re still working on your blog post to prevent it from showing up on your listing page, site map, or site search.

    "text": "V. Some additional authoring features to explore\nBlog posts are just Quarto documents, meaning you can combine prose, code, and embedded outputs all in one place, just like you would in any other .qmd file (which makes your blog the perfect place to create data science/programming tutorials both for yourself and others Winking Face). If you’re looking for additional ways to enhance your posts, read on below:\n\nAdding footnotes\nThere are multiple ways to include footnotes throughout your blog posts:\n\nUse the [^#] syntax to denote where you would like a note to be inserted. Write your note somewhere below following the [^#]: your note here syntax. For example:\n\n\nI am going to insert a footnote here[^1].\n\n[^1]: Here is the associated footnote, which will appear at the bottom of my document in a \"Footnotes\" section.\n\n\nAlternatively, you can write your notes inline to avoid having to use identifiers (e.g. [^#]). For example:\n\n\nI am going to insert an inline footnote here^[Here is my inline footnote].\n\n\nYou can also add footnotes that include multiple paragraphs. See the source code for this blog post and take a peek at footnote #2 for an example on how to do so (or check out the Quarto documentation).\n\nAll footnotes will appear in a “Footnotes” section that is automatically generated for you.\n\n\nCreating a bibliography and adding citations\nQuarto supports the use of bibliography files for citing works throughout your blog post. There are a number of ways to do this, but so far, I’ve found creating a BibLaTex database to be relatively straightforward. This database takes the form of a plain-text .bib file where we can store all of our bibliographic information. That information needs to be encoded in a particular way (more on that below). Follow these steps to cite works in your blog posts:\n\nFirst, create a .bib file in the folder containing your blog post (e.g. mywebsite/posts/2022-10-24-my-blog-post/references.bib) using the touch command in your RStudio Terminal. I called mine references.bib, but the name is up to you.\nTo use your references.bib file, you’ll need to add the bibliography option to your blog post’s YAML:\n\n\n---\ntitle: \"blog post title\"\n# ~ additional YAML options omitted for brevity ~\nbibliography: references.bib\n---\n\n\nNext, we’ll want to add some references. These take a particular format that generally looks like this (the number/types of fields included may vary):\n\n\n@type{key,\n  author = {LastName, FirstName},\n  title = {Title of work},\n  date = {YYYY}\n  url = {https://url.com},\n  langid = {en}\n}\n\nwhere type can be manual, book, article, misc, etc. (all case-insensitive) and key is the citation identifier used for inserting in-text citations (we’ll get there soon).\n\nThere may be instances where you want to cite a resource that already has a BibTex citation available for you to copy over to your references.bib file (e.g. this blog post). For most resources, however, you’ll need to construct your own. You can do this manually, or with the help of a BibTeX reference generator (Googling will yield plenty of options, but zoterobib is a great place to start. Note that you may have to make some manual adjustments). Check out my references.bib file for this post as an example.\n\n\nNow that you have BibTex references in your .bib file, you can start adding in-text citations. These generally take the form [@key] (but read more about Quarto citation syntax here). When you add an in-text citation, Quarto will automatically add the reference to the bottom of your blog post under the “References” section.\n\n\nTo give one final concrete example, let’s say I want to cite my first (ever) blog post from last year. I can copy the BibTeX citation from the bottom of the post and paste it into my references.bib file:\n\n\n@online{csik2021,\n  author = {Samantha Csik},\n  title = {Why Create Presentation Slides about Blogging When You Can\n    Just Blog about It Instead?},\n  date = {2021-09-24},\n  url = {https://samanthacsik.github.io/posts/2021-09-21-distill-blogs/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\n\n\nI can now add an in-text citation using the [@csik2021] syntax here arrow-right (Csik 2021). Once cited, it will appear in my References section at the bottom of this post.\n\nThat wasn’t so bad, right?? What if I told you there was an even easier way to add citations….Start by popping over to RStudio’s Visual editor, if you’re not already there (you should see buttons for working in either the Source or Visual editor in the top left corner of your source pane), and follow the steps below:\n\nPlace your cursor where you’d like to insert a citation, then from the Insert drop down menu, select Citation.\nA new window will pop open with a number of different options for inserting citations. If you’ve already created a references.bib file, it will appear under the My Sources and Bibliography sections. You can choose any of your existing references to insert an in-text citation from or choose another option, like inserting a citation based on a DOI (!!! I can’t tell you how awesome I think this is !!!). Once you add an in-text citation based on a DOI, the BibTeX reference will automatically be added to your references.bib file, as well as to your references list at the bottom of your post. If you don’t yet have a references.bib file, one will automatically be generated for you. LIKE SERIOUSLY?? SO FREAKIN COOL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay, back to being chill…\n\n\nArticle layout\nQuarto also supports a number of different page layout options to further customize the appearance of your posts. Explore different ways to position elements on your page, including embedding outputs, captions, references in your page margin (one of my personal faves…despite the fact that I don’t have any here in this post)."

Present a coding problem and solution\nKaija Gahm (woodpeckeR) defines a coding problem, provides some context, and describes her solution along with why it works in her post, %$%: upping your pipe game (Gahm 2021).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvii. Share how you use code as a creative medium\nIjeamaka Anyene is a computational aRtist who shares her process of creating abstract geometrical rectangular designs (check out her ‘Subdivisions Series’ on her Etsy shop) in her post, So, you want to subdivide a rectangle (Anyene 2021).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nviii. Document the evolution of your code in multiple posts\nMatt Kerlogue (The Lapsed Geographer) details his use of the {pdftools} and tidyverse packages in R to web scrape and wrangle COVID-19 data from UK reports in his post, Scraping Google’s COVID-19 mobility report PDFs (Kerlogue 2020b). He later follows up with instructions on how to automate this process for reports from ~130 countries and all 50 US states in his post, Automating the COVID-19 PDF scraping (Kerlogue 2020a).\n\n\n\n\nNow that we’re all feeling inspired to flex our creative data science muscles, let’s create and customize our own blog posts Blog"

    "text": "III. Adding a distill blog to your personal website\nDisclaimer: A lot of the following content (sections III & IV) is just a compilation of excellent existing resources. I learn by repeating things (usually many times), so taking the time to type out code/YAML headers has been helpful, albeit not at all novel. See a list of referenced resources at the bottom of this post.\nIf you have not yet made a distill site, there are many great tutorials out there. For MEDS students, I recommend following along with these step-by-step instructions by Allison Horst before moving forward. For a very brief intro on customizing your distill site using CSS, check out these slides.\n\nNote: The following section was adapted from Hill (2020)\n\nNow that you have your distill site up and running, you can create your first blog post by running the distill::create_post() function in your console:\n\ncreate_post(title = \"My blog post\")\n\nIf this is the first time you are creating a blog post, {distill} will add a directory called _posts/, which will contain this plus all future blog posts. You will also need to create a listing page, which will list all of your posts. Do this by adding a blank .Rmd file to your root directory by running utils::file.edit(\"blog.Rmd\") in your console, then add a YAML header to your new file as follows:\n\n---\ntitle: \"Blog\"  # any name you want\nlisting: posts # do this exactly\n---\n\nFinally, link your new listing page to your website’s navbar by editing _site.yml. Note: Since I named my listing .Rmd file as blog.Rmd, the href I need to link to is blog.html.\n\nnavbar:\n  right:\n    - text: \"Home\"\n      href: index.html\n    - text: \"Blog\"      # add \n      href: blog.html   # add"

    "text": "IV. Customizing your distill blog & posts\nA couple simple touches can go a long way in improving the look of your distill blog. Here are some of the steps I followed to customize my first blog post.\n\nNote: This section’s content was largely adapted from Allaire et al. (2018)\n\n\ni. Preview images\nPreview images are those fun little thumbnails that appear alongside blog posts on your listing page:\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd your image to the folder where your blog post .Rmd lives (e.g. _posts -&gt; YYYY-MM-DD-my-blog-post -&gt; my_preview_image.jpeg). Then, add the preview field to the YAML header of your blog post .Rmd file and set the value to the name of your preview image:\n\n---\ntitle: \"my blog post\"\n# (additional metadata excluded for brevity)\npreview: my_preview_image.jpeg  # your preview image\n---\n\n\n\nii. Categories\nYou can assign each post to one or more “categories,” making it easier for your readers to filter content. Do so by adding the categories field to the YAML header of your blog post .Rmd file, then list whichever self-defined categories you would like your post to be assigned to. For example, I assigned this blog post to two catetories: distill and R:\n\n---\ntitle: \"Why create slides about blogging when you can just blog about it instead?\"\n# (additional metadata excluded for brevity)\ncategories:\n  - distill # list as many categories as you'd like \n  - R \n---\n\nTake a look at your listing page to see all your categories (and how many articles are assigned to each). Assigned categories will also appear as metadata at the top of each post.\n\n\niii. Table of contents\nTable of contents can be helpful for readers to navigate longer posts. Add the toc (and optionally, toc_float) field to your blog’s YAML header as shown below:\n\n---\ntitle: \"my blog post\"\n# (additional metadata excluded for brevity)\noutput:\n  distill::distill_article:\n    self_contained: false\n    toc: true              # add a table of contents\n    toc_float: true        # float it (positioned on the left-hand side, rather at the top)\n---\n\n\n\niv. Citations\nYou can add automatically-generated citations to the bottom of your posts, making it easier for readers to reference your work.\nI did this by first adding the base_url field to my _site.yml and set the value to the landing page URL of my distill site. For example:\n\n---\nname: \"samanthacsik.github.io\"\ntitle: \"Samantha Csik\"\n# (additional metadata excluded for brevity)\nbase_url: samanthacsik.github.io # add your website's landing page url\n---\n\nI then specified the slug (the unique identifying part of a web address) in the YAML header of my blog post .Rmd file (a slug will be automatically generated if not provided):\n\n---\ntitle: \"Why create slides about blogging when you can just blog about it instead?\"\n# (additional metadata excluded for brevity)\nslug: csik2021firstBlog\n---\n\nYour citations will now appear as metadata at the bottom of your post upon knitting.\n\n\nv. Bibliographies\nYou can use standard R Markdown bibliographies to cite works throughout your post and include a corresponding “References” list. You will first need to create a .bib file in the folder containing your blog post. You can do so by running the file.edit() function in your console. For example:\n\nfile.edit(\"_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-my-blog-post/bibliography.bib\")\n\nNext, add the bibliograhy field to the YAML header of your blog post .Rmd file and set the value to the name of your new .bib file:\n\n---\ntitle: \"my blog post\"\n# (additional metadata excluded for brevity)\nbibliography: bibliography.bib\n---\n\nNow, add citation information to your .bib file. This is super easy if you are citing a distill article that has citation information already included – just copy and paste! Note: there are different formats (e.g. CSL or BibTeX) for creating bibliography files. I chose to use BibTeX.\nFor example, Allaire et al. (2018) includes the following BibTeX citation at the end of their post, which I have copied into my .bib file:\n\n@misc{allaire2018distill,\n  author = {Allaire, JJ and Iannone, Rich and Presmanes Hill, Alison and Xie, Yihui},\n  title = {Distill for R Markdown},\n  url = {https://rstudio.github.io/distill},\n  year = {2018}\n}\n\nNote the format of this citation, where type can be manual, book, article, misc, etc. (all case-insensitive) and key is the citation reference used for inserting in-text citations.\n\n@type{key,\n  ...\n  }\n\nTo include an in-text citation for the above reference, type @allaire2018distill (or if you prefer your citation to be inside parentheses, [@allaire2018distill]). Adding the in-text citation will automatically add the full reference to your “References” list at the bottom of your post. To read more about including bibliographies and citations in your blog posts, see Xie (2021) and Xie, Dervieux, and Riederer (2021).\n\n\nvi. Appendices\nWhile citations and references will be automatically added as appendices to your blog post (if you followed along with the steps above), you can add additional content here by adding the .appendix class to any level 1 or level 2 header. For example, I added an additional “Corrections” statement to my appendix below by typing:\n## Corrections {.appendix}\nIf you see mistakes or want to suggest changes...\n \nI had a ton of fun playing around with some of these easy-to-implement features that the {distill} package provides for customizing blog posts. And I had even more fun checking out other data science blogs as I looked for inspiration. I hope they inspired you too! Happy blogging Beaming Face With Smiling Eyes"

However, whether you’re a new learner or seasoned programmer, it can sometimes feel overwhelming to know exactly where to start – especially when you have an end goal that builds additional complexity/flexibility into your functions and for loops. Taking an iterative approach to building out your code can help make this process clearer, less daunting, and more fun. In this workshop, we’ll use one case study to practice breaking down the function and for loop writing process into manageable, bite-sized steps."

I am also a co-organizer of R-Ladies Santa Barbara, a local data science group which works to promote gender diversity in the R community.\nMy background is in marine ecology / ecophysiology – I was afforded opportunities to study coral disease in Panama and the Florida Keys as an undergrad, then temperature effects on spiny lobster metabolism and foraging behavior in Santa Barbara for my Masters degree. Since the beginning of my time in STEM, I was totally terrified of all things data/coding/data science, but thanks to a super supportive community and some really rad colleagues/instructors, I found my new path in data science education and I absolutely love it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeaching MEDS students how to build their own personal websites using Quarto!

Primarily, I focus on developing and delivering workshop-style classes that supplement the MEDS core curriculum. I teach primarily via live-coding (where my computer is hooked up to a screen for workshop participants to see and hear me talk through code in real time as they follow along on their own computers) – this teaching style was invaluable in my own development as a data scientist, and I really believe that, when done well, live-coding can be a game-changing experience for early-career coders and data scientists. I am always looking for new ways to make my teaching style and materials more approachable and inclusive for all learners – I try to build my materials to be stand-alone resources both for participants to refer back to and also for those learning on their own time."

    "text": "the hobby\nI feel very fortunate to be doing so many of things that I love a lot right now. That includes my job, but also spending lots of time outdoors. Living in Santa Barbara is a massive privilege and being here means that we have access to both the mountains and the sea, each a few minutes in either direction. It was the ocean that brought me here originally, but most of my free time is now spent on the trails.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy right-hand hiking gal, Tallie (aka TunaB).\n\n\n\n\nI started recording my hikes (and eventually some other activities) on Strava in late 2020 and finally got around to retrieving my activity data using the {rStrava} package. Below is a heatmap of all my recorded activities made using leaflet. It’s challenging to see individual markers at my most frequented trail heads/starting points, so I’ve recently began building out my own Strava Dashboard (using {shinydashboard}) to make it a bit more interactive and filterable – it’s a work in progress, but a fun side project that I’m excited to continue iterating upon. Huge shout out to Daniel Cullen (who also happens to be a Santa Barbara resident!) for his awesome blogpost that got me started with my own map.\n\n\nFeel free to check out my Strava dashboard, Sam’s Strava Stats (still working on a better name…)! Source code available on GitHub GitHub.\n\n\n\n \n \n\nMap last updated: May 1, 2023"

    "text": "the logo\nI’m a proud Csik (pronounced “chick” – Hungarian, for the curious), though I spent many of my younger years embarrassed when people (understandably) got it wrong (variations include “sea-sick,” “sick,” “ca-sick,” to name a few) – and many of us know how brutal little kid peers can be when there’s a funny way to mispronounce a name. At some point, I learned to embrace the weird and it became very much a part of my everyday identity. My track coaches and teammates would shout “LET’S GO CSIK” during my events at meets, I signed year books as “Sam [drawing of a chick]” and every handmade card received my “The Csik Press” identifying mark on the back. As I’ve grown older, I’ve taken more care to help colleagues, peers, and strangers learn the correct pronunciation – because if I’m being totally honest, I think my name is pretty darn cool Face Smile Wink. So my first ever real logo is an homage to my earliest attempts at claiming my Csik identity. It may evolve a bit, but for now, it makes me pretty happy. Made using the (free!) Adobe Express logo maker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe back of a handmade birthday card by yours truly (aka ‘The Csik Press’). Thanks, Mom, for sending me pics of these decade+ old treasures whenever you come across them. Artist: Sam Csik. Medium: construction paper, Elmer’s glue. Date: 2010 (apparently)."
