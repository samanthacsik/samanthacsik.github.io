# Abstract

Before ever touching a computer or writing a line of code, itâ€™s helpful (and important!) to begin by thinking intentionally about the story you want to tell, and how best to tell it. In this workshop, we'll consider a variety of different visualizations and discuss which design elements and decisions most effectively communicate insights and engage audiences. We'll then review some strategies for designing clear and compelling charts, and begin brainstorming ways to visually communicate key insights from your own BEL research projects.

# Audience

This workshop was developed for the the 2025 [Bren Environmental Leadership (BEL) fellows](https://bren.ucsb.edu/undergrad-mentoring/bren-environmental-leadership-bel-program). The BEL program aims to increase the representation of first-generation, low-income, and underrepresented students pursuing careers in the environmental field and natural sciences. As part of the program, undergraduate fellows receive mentorship from graduate students, conduct a summer research project, and participate in professional development workshops and community-building events.
