# Abstract 

`{ggplot2}` has, in many ways, become the de facto tool for data visualization in R. And with the many extension packages available, there's hardly a limit to what you can create. Building effective and visually-pleasing data visualizations is a skill that gets easier with practice, and following a somewhat structured workflow -- at least at the start -- can help you get there faster. This workshop covers one approach for doing so, though you'll find what works best for you with time.

# Audience

This workshop was originally developed for the [Master of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) program](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/), administered by the [Bren School of Environmental Science & Management](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science) in partnership with the [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/).
