# Abstract

Quarto provides a user-friendly framework for creating your personal website -- but adding your own creative touch can help make yours stand out from the rest. In this workshop, we learn how to (a) add a template to our landing page and update the `_quarto.yml` file to quickly add fun features/update the overall layout of our website, (b) create a stylesheet and define Sass variables to start modifying the overall theme (colors, fonts, etc) of our site, and (c) define CSS rules to make fine-tuned adjustments to our site's appearance.
