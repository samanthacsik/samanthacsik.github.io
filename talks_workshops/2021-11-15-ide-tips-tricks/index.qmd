It became clear after two cohorts of students that delivering tons of shortcut all at once (in the form of an hour-long workshop; see slide deck, below) was not particularly helpful or effective (learners aren't given sufficient time to practice and build muscle memory). We tried out something new in summer 2023, and instead presented a few "Keyboard Shortcuts of the Week" throughout the 6-week long MEDS summer session. Overall, I think this was a much needed change to content delivery! You can read more about the format and shortcuts list on [this wiki](https://github.com/UCSB-MEDS/IDE-tips-and-tricks/wiki/Updated-Approach-for-Delivering-IDE-Tips-&-Tricks---Keyboard-Shortcuts).

# Abstract

As environmental data scientists, we spend a lot of time in RStudio. Taking some time to learn how you can customize your RStudio IDE (**I**ntegrated **D**evelopment **E**nvironment) and the keyboard shortcuts used to navigate around that IDE can make you a more efficient (and happier) hacker!
