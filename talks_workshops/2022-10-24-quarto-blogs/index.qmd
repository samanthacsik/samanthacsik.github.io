# Abstract 

Blogging about your data science adventures has **a lot** of benefits – it can help you to build your online profile/portfolio, practice your writing and communication skills, stay atop data science trends, solicit feedback from the community, network, learn new skills and/or solidify understanding, combat imposter syndrome, etc. In this workshop, we’ll learn how to add a blog to our Quarto website, customize posts, and (hopefully) get inspired to begin our blogging journeys!

# Audience
