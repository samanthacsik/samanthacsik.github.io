# Abstract

“The Cloud” is a buzzword we often hear, but maybe don’t quite understand. In this workshop, we’ll learn a bit about what cloud computing means and what it can look like, how to launch a virtual machine (i.e. an instance) using Amazon Web Services (AWS), and how we can leverage more powerful computers (e.g. the cloud) to run computationally-intensive processes in less time.

# Audience

This workshop was originally developed for the [Master of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) program](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/), administered by the [Bren School of Environmental Science & Management](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science) in partnership with the [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/).
