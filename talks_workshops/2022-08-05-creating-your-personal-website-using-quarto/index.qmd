# Abstract

A personal website is not only a great way to showcase your experiences and skills, but also gives people (potential employers included!) a better sense of who you are as a person. There are lots of great tools for building websites using R (e.g. `{distill}`, `{blogdown}`) -- this year, we'll be using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), an exciting, new, and versatile publishing tool that supports R, Python, Julia, and ObservableJS. Want to get started on building your own website using Quarto? Check out this [tutorial](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/creating-quarto-websites/).
