::: {#bio}
Hi there! I'm Sam Shanny-Csik (pronounced "shan-knee chick"). Professionally, I love **teaching data science skills**, learning and implementing **inclusive pedagogical approaches**, and the communities that support both of those things. Outside of work, I'm an **avid hiker**, novice (but passionate) meal-maker, and an on-again-off-again book worm. Poke around to learn more [about me](about.qmd) and my work!
