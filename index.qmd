### hi there!    

I'm Sam (and my last name is pronounced "chick"). I'm the Data Training Coordinator at the [National Center for Ecological Analysis & Synthesis](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/) (NCEAS) located at UC Santa Barbara, where I'm working to develop and teach data science training curricula for the [Master of Environmental Data Science](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science) (MEDS) program and other data science initiatives across NCEAS and UCSB. I am also a co-organizer of [R-Ladies Santa Barbara](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-santa-barbara/), a local data science group which works to promote diversity in the R community. In my spare time, you'll typically find me hiking with my pup or cooking family dinners with friends.
