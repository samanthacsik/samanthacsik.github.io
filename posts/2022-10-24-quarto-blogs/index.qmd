About a year ago (2021), I wrote my first ever blog post \~ about blogging \~ and tbh I'm a *little* embarrassed that this is only my third post here (does it count that I have *ideas* for blog posts squirreled away at least?? {{< fa face-grin-beam-sweat title="a grinning face with a bead of sweat dripping from its brow" >}}). Regardless, you should trust me[^1] when I say that blogging is a great exercise for you to practice as regularly as you can -- it can help you to:

[^1]: Okay, you don't *just* have to trust me. Lots of data scientists advocate for blogging as an important skill and communication tool. Check out this [blog post](http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/) by [David Robinson](https://twitter.com/drob) to start.

## I. Before we chat about blogs... {#I-MEDS}

Our [Master of Environmental Data Science](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science){target="_blank"} (MEDS) students created the bones of their Quarto websites a couple months ago, and more recently took a little dive into website customization using Sass & CSS. For anyone who's looking to get started on their website-building journey, feel free to explore the following resources:

{{< fa window-maximize title="Web browser window">}} [Creating your personal website using Quarto](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/creating-quarto-websites/){target="_blank"}

{{< fa palette title="Painters palette">}} [Customizing Quarto Websites: Make your website stand out using Sass & CSS](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/customizing-quarto-websites/#/title-slide){target="_blank"}

## II. What's the difference between a website and a blog? {#II-blog-vs-website}

If you've spent some time poking around the official [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/){target="_blank"}, you may have noticed instructions for creating either a [**Website**](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/){target="_blank"} or a [**Blog**](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html){target="_blank"} -- but what's the difference? Not much, aside from the initial structure:

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| column: page
#| fig-subcap: 
#| - "When you create a new Quarto website, it'll look like this (it has a traditional landing (i.e. 'Home') page and no incorporated blog)..."
#| - "... while a new Quarto blog will look like this (with a listing page as your landing page)"
knitr::include_graphics("media/website.png")
knitr::include_graphics("media/blog.png")
```

**A Quarto Blog is *a type* of Quarto Website** -- you can create websites that consist of just a single blog (like the above right-hand example), websites that have multiple blogs, or you can add a blog to a website that contains other content (which is what we'll be doing today).

## III. Adding a blog to your personal Quarto website {#III-add-blog}

::: dark-green-bg
**TL;DR:** A couple of steps are required for setting up your blog, but generally speaking, you'll need:

A.  **a folder** (i.e. subdirectory) to hold all of your individual blog posts -- I called my folder `posts/` (though the name is up to you). I also (optionally) added a `_metadata.yml` file to this folder which includes some formatting and configuration options that will apply to *all* blog posts in this folder

B.  **a listing page**, which lists all of your blog posts for viewers to browse and click through -- this is a `.qmd` file that you'll add to your website's navbar by including it in `_quarto.yml`

C.  **blog posts!** Your listing page will be blank until you actually add your first blog post
:::

<br>

Let's create those together now.

## NEW! Choose your own adventure instructions

I've spent a lot of July 2025 playing around with Posit's newest IDE, [Positron](https://positron.posit.co/), and I'm really enjoying it! It's been helpful for me to translate the location of RStudio's GUI buttons to the Positron environment, so I’ve updated the instructions below to include guidance for working in Positron, alongside RStudio and the Terminal. Feel free to use whichever environment you prefer and follow the corresponding instructions as you go.
:::

### 1. Create a `posts/` folder

-   Open up your Quarto website project and make sure you're in your root directory. Here, we'll create a new subdirectory, called `posts` (though you can call this whatever you want), where all of our blog posts will eventually live.

::: panel-tabset
## {{< fa brands r-project title="R programming language icon" >}} RStudio

i.  Click on the **Create a new folder** button in the Files pane:

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "80%"
#| fig-align: "center"
knitr::include_graphics("media/new-folder-rstudio.png")
```

ii. Type `posts`, the click **OK**

## {{< fa plus title="plus symbol" >}} Positron

i.  Click on the **New Folder...** button, which appears when you hover over your repository name in the Explorer menu:

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "80%"
#| fig-align: "center"
knitr::include_graphics("media/new-folder-positron.png")
```

ii. Type `posts`, then click **Enter / Return**

## {{< fa terminal title="terminal symbol, |>" >}} Terminal

i.  Make sure you're in your root directory by typing, `pwd` (you should see it return something like, `file/path/to/your-repo`)
ii. If you're *not* in your root directory, use the `cd` command to move yourself there
iii. Run `mkdir posts` to create your `posts/` folder
:::

### 2. *Optional:* Add a `_metadata.yml` file to `posts/`

-   While not required, a `_metadata.yml` file can make your life easier if you want certain configurations to apply to *all* blog posts that you create.

::: panel-tabset
## {{< fa brands r-project title="R programming language icon" >}} RStudio

i.  Click into the `posts/` folder in the Files pane, then click **Blank File** \> **Text File** \> type `_metadata.yml`
ii. Click **OK**

## {{< fa plus title="plus symbol" >}} Positron

i.  Right click on your `posts/` folder in the Explorer menu, then choose **New File...**
ii. Type `_metadata.yml`, then click **Enter / Return**

## {{< fa terminal title="terminal symbol, |>" >}} Terminal

i.  Run `cd posts` to move from your repository's root directory into your `posts/` directory
ii. Run `touch _metadata.yml` to create your file
:::

-   Open your `_metadata.yml` file to add options. I like these options[^2] for getting started, but it's entirely up to you what you want to include (if anything at all):

[^2]: **The `freeze` option:** Setting this option to `auto` will *only* re-render posts when you make updates to the source files (as opposed to re-rendering them each time you **Render Website** -- this can save time, particularly if you have computationally-heavy content in your blog posts). If you set this option to `true`, posts will *never* be re-rendered (even if you've made changes to the source files). If you use this option, you'll need to **Render** individual posts whenever you make changes to their source files *before* you **Render Website**, otherwise your updates will not appear. Check out [the Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/code-execution.html#freeze){target="_blank"} and [this great short blog post](https://mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/quarto-tip-a-day/posts/03-freeze/index.html){target="_blank"} for more information on `freeze`.

    **The `title-block-banner` option:** Setting this option to `true` will enable a [banner style title block](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/title-blocks.html#title-banners){target="_blank"} (where the title, subtitle, description, and categories are all positioned inside the banner) for all posts.

```{r filename="_metadata.yml"}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
##~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
##        options specified here will apply to all posts in this folder     ----
##~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# re-render posts only when a change to the source file is made ----
freeze: auto

# enable banner style title blocks ----
title-block-banner: true
```

-   We'll return to the `_metadata.yml` file a little later on to see how adding more YAML options can help to streamline authoring blog posts.

### 3. Create a [listing page](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-listings.html){target="_blank"}

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## **What is a listing page?**

A listing page is a web page with content that is automatically generated from a list of documents -- in this case, that would be a list of blog posts -- and looks something like this (or check out [my blog's listing page](https://samanthacsik.github.io/posts.html){target="_blank"}):

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: "center"
#| fig-cap: "An example listing page from the [Quarto Blog](https://quarto.org/docs/blog/) showing multiple blog posts. Quarto has multiple [listing page layout options](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-listings.html#listing-types) (`default` (shown above), `grid`, and `table`) for you to try out."
knitr::include_graphics("media/quarto-listing-page.png")
```
:::

-   Your listing page takes the form of a `.qmd` file that lives in your repository's *root* directory (I'll be calling mine `posts.qmd` and giving it the title "My Blog" for demonstration purposes, though you can choose whatever file name and title you'd like). ***Note:** There are lots of different ways to create a new `.qmd` file. I outline just one approach for each environment, below:*

:::: panel-tabset
## {{< fa brands r-project title="R programming language icon" >}} RStudio

***Tip:** Click on the R Project icon, <img src="media/rproj.png" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0; position: relative; top: 2px; width:20px;height:20px;"/>, in the Files pane to jump back to your project's root directory*

i.  From the menu bar, click **File** \> **New File** \> **Quarto Document...**
ii. When the dialog box opens, give it a **Title** (e.g. "My Blog") -- this is the name that will appear as the title of your listing page (you'll be able to change this later by editing the YAML)
iii. Click **Create** (this will open the file in the Editor)
iv. Save (keyboard shortcut: `Cmd`/`Ctrl` + `S`) your new file as `posts.qmd`

## {{< fa plus title="plus symbol" >}} Positron

i.  Open the Command Palette using the keyboard shortcut, `Cmd/Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P`
ii. Search **Quarto: New Document**, then click **Enter / Return** (this will open your file in the Editor)
iii. Update the `title` YAML option with your preferred title (e.g. "My Blog")
iv. Save (keyboard shortcut: `Cmd`/`Ctrl` + `S`) your new file to your repository's root directory as `posts.qmd` (choose your root directory from the **Where:** dropdown menu if it's not already selected by default)

## {{< fa terminal title="terminal symbol, |>" >}} Terminal

i.  Make sure you’re in your root directory by typing, `pwd`
ii. If you’re not in your root directory, use the `cd` command to move yourself there
iii. Run `touch posts.qmd` to create your file

*At this point I **highly recommend** opening and editing your `posts.qmd` file using an IDE like RStudio or Positron. However, if you're really excited to practice editing files from the Terminal, you can try out the following steps:*

iv. Open `posts.qmd` with a Terminal-based text editor (e.g [Nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/){target="_blank"}, [Vim](https://www.vim.org/){target="_blank"}; you may need to install your preferred text editor first, depending on your operating system) -- I like nano, so I'll run `nano posts.qmd` to open `posts.qmd` using that editor.
v.  Add the YAML gates and `title` option with your preferred title (e.g. "My Blog"):

```{markdown filename="posts.qmd"}
---
title: "My Blog"
---
```

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "80%"
#| fig-align: "center"
knitr::include_graphics("media/nano.png")
```

::: {.center-text .small-text .gray-italic}
Editing `posts.qmd` using nano in a Terminal window (as it appears on my Mac)
:::

vi. Click `Ctrl` + `X` to exit, then type `Y` when it asks you if you'd like to save your work. Click **Enter / Return** to exit nano.
::::

```{=html}
<!-- ::: {.panel-tabset}
## {{< fa brands r-project title="R programming language icon" >}} RStudio
## {{< fa plus title="plus symbol" >}} Positron
## {{< fa terminal title="terminal symbol, |>" >}} Terminal
::: -->
```

### 4. Configure your listing page

-   Specify how you'd like your listing page to be arranged by updating the YAML section of `posts.qmd`. There are a variety of options that you can specify. Below are just a few, so be sure to check out [other options](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-listings.html){target="_blank"}:

```{r filename="posts.qmd"}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
---
title: "My Blog"
listing: 
  contents: posts # this name must match the name of the folder you created in step #1; here, all Quarto docs in the `posts` directory will be included on your listing page
  type: grid # or `default` or `table`; each type has its own set of yaml options to include
  sort: "date desc" # can also sort on more than one field
  categories: true # allows you to sort posts by assigned categories 
---
```

### 5. Add your listing page to your website's navbar

-   Visitors will have a difficult time finding your listing page if it's not linked somewhere obvious. Update `_quarto.yml` with your new listing page to add it to your site's navbar:

```{r filename="_quarto.yml"}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
# ~ parts of `_quarto.yml` omitted for brevity ~

website:
  navbar:
    title: myWebsiteTitle
    right:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - about.qmd
      - posts.qmd # add your listing page file to your navbar, just like you would any other new web page

```

### 6. Preview your website

-   Make sure your listing page shows up by previewing your website. Run `quarto preview` in your Terminal (this can be your RStudio or Positron Terminal, or in a separate Terminal window) to open up a live preview in a browser window. You should see something that looks like this (we haven't created any posts yet, so it'll be empty for now):

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: "center"
#| out-width: "100%"
#| fig-alt: "A listing page titled, 'My Blog,' appears in the navbar of our website. It's currently an empty listing page (i.e. no blog posts appear on the listing page) since we haven't created any blog posts yet."
knitr::include_graphics("media/blog-added.png")
```

## IV. Add a blog post to your blog {#IV-add-post}

Now that you have your listing page set up, we can start populating it with blog posts. ***Repeat the following steps each time you want to add a new post.***

### 1. Create a subdirectory *inside* your `posts/` directory:

-   To stay organized, I usually name mine `YYYY-MM-DD-short-post-description`. This folder name will also become the [slug](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Slug){target="_blank"} for your published post.

### 2. Create an `index.qmd` file *inside* your new subdirectory

-   Your file path should look something like this: `myWebsite/posts/2022-10-24-my-blog-post/index.qmd`. This file is your blog post. Write all your content here!

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## **Why name your blog post file, `index.qmd`?**

This is mostly important for maintaining short, clean URLs.

Let's take this very blog post for example. The content that you're reading right now is written to the file, `samanthacsik.github.io/posts/2022-10-24-quarto-blogs/index.qmd` (you can check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/samanthacsik/samanthacsik.github.io/blob/main/posts/2022-10-24-quarto-blogs/index.qmd){target="_blank"}), and the resulting URL is <https://samanthacsik.github.io/posts/2022-10-24-quarto-blogs/>.

If I named my blog post file something like, `my-blog-post.qmd` (*rather than `index.qmd`*), the resulting URL would instead look like, <https://samanthacsik.github.io/posts/2022-10-24-quarto-blogs/my-blog-post.html>. This isn't necessarily *wrong* or broken, but it does result in a lengthier URL -- and short URLs tend to be easier to remember.
:::

### 3. Configure your blog post

-   You can add a variety of different options to the YAML section of `index.qmd`. Here are my go-to options:

```{r filename="posts/2022-10-24-my-blog-post/index.qmd"}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
---
title: "blog post title" # <1>
description: "blog post description (appears underneath the title in smaller text) which is included on the listing page"
author: # <2>
  - name: Samantha Csik # <2>
    url: https://samanthacsik.github.io/ # <2>
    orcid: 0000-0002-5300-3075 # <2>
    affiliation: Master of Environmental Data Science Program @ The Bren School (UCSB) & The National Center for Ecological Analysis & Synthesis # <2>
    affiliation-url: https://ucsb-meds.github.io/ # <2>
date: 10-24-2022
categories: [Quarto, R, MEDS] # <3>
citation: # <4>
  url: https://samanthacsik.github.io/posts/2022-10-24-my-blog-post/ # <4>
image: preview-image.png # <5>
draft: false # <6>
---

Here is where I will start writing my actual blog post content...
```

1.  You should include a **title**, but don't necessarily need a **description** (though I think these are nice to include!). These fields will appear on your listing page. You may also consider adding a **subtitle**.
2.  You can include more than one **author** -- see [this post](https://samanthacsik.github.io/posts/2022-06-22-hello-quarto/){target="_blank"} and [source code](https://github.com/samanthacsik/samanthacsik.github.io/blob/main/posts/2022-06-22-hello-quarto/index.qmd){target="_blank"} as an example.
3.  You may include as many self-defined **categories** as you'd like. Make sure that your spelling / capitalization / punctuation is consistent across blog posts should you apply the same categories to multiple posts.
4.  Adding the **citation** option automatically generates both a [BibTeX citation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX){target="_blank"} and reference for your blog post, and adds them to the bottom of your post.
5.  Include an image to add as a **preview image**, which will appear on your listing page alongside your post. Your image should live inside your post's subdirectory (e.g. `mywebsite/posts/2022-10-24-my-blog-post/preview-image.png`).
6.  Set **`draft: true`** while you're still working on your blog post to prevent it from showing up on your listing page, site map, or site search (it will still be available at a searchable URL). When you're ready to publish, just remove `draft: true` from your YAML (or set to `false`), then render your post. Quarto v1.5.56 introduced draft banners, which will appear on any draft posts. You can also control how drafts are linked / rendered on your website using the [`draft-mode` option](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-drafts.html#appearance-of-drafts){target="_blank"}. By default, any page set as a draft will not be linked or searchable. If you want your draft to still be searchable at it's URL (helpful if you want to share a draft with someone, but don't want it showing up on your listing page just yet), consider setting `draft-mode` to either `unlinked` or `visible` -- check out the [documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-drafts.html) for more information.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| column: page
#| fig-subcap: 
#| - "A grid-style listing page featuring one blog post with a preview image, title, three categories, description, author, and publishing date"
#| - "An example draft blog post, with a banner-style title block. The draft notice will disappear and the blog post will appear on the listing page once `draft` is set to `false`."
knitr::include_graphics("media/ex-listing-page.png")
knitr::include_graphics("media/my-first-post.png")
```

### 4. Consider moving YAML options to `_metadata.yml`, as appropriate

-   For example, do you want your own author / affiliation information applied to each blog post you write, by default? Add it instead to `_metadata.yml` and save yourself re-typing it each time you create a new post! Here, I modify my `_metadata.yml` and `posts/2022-10-24-my-blog-post/index.qmd` files:

::: panel-tabset
## \_metadata.yml

```{markdown filename="_metadata.yml"}
##~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
##        options specified here will apply to all posts in this folder     ----
##~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# re-render posts only when a change to the source file is made ----
freeze: auto

# enable banner style title blocks ----
title-block-banner: true

# my author info ----
author:
  - name: Samantha Shanny-Csik
    url: https://samanthacsik.github.io/
    orcid: 0000-0002-5300-3075
    affiliation: Master of Environmental Data Science Program @ The Bren School (UCSB) 
    affiliation-url: https://ucsb-meds.github.io/ 
```

## Blog post YAML

```{r filename="posts/2022-10-24-my-blog-post/index.qmd"}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
---
title: "blog post title" 
description: "blog post description (appears underneath the title in smaller text) which is included on the listing page"
# I no longer need to include my authorship information here -- it'll automatically be applied from _metadata.yml!
date: 10-24-2022
categories: [Quarto, R, MEDS] 
citation: 
  url: https://samanthacsik.github.io/posts/2022-10-24-my-blog-post/ 
image: preview-image.png 
draft: false 
---

Here is where I will start writng my actual blog post content...
```
:::

-   Are you collaborating on a blog post with additional authors? You can override the defaults set in `_metadata.yml` by specifying the `author` option directly in any particular blog post file's YAML.

## V. Troubleshooting {#V-troubleshooting}

**If things aren't working as expected, double check your repository structure** -- it should be organized similar to this:

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("media/repo-structure.png")
```

## VI. Some additional authoring features to explore {#VI-additional-features}

Blog posts are just Quarto documents, meaning you can combine prose, code, and embedded outputs all in one place, just like you would in any other `.qmd` file (which makes your blog the *perfect* place to create data science / programming tutorials both for yourself and others {{< fa smile-wink title="a smiling winking face" >}}). If you're looking for additional ways to enhance your posts, read on below:

### Adding footnotes

There are multiple ways to include footnotes throughout your blog posts:

1.  **Use the `[^#]` syntax to denote where you would like a note to be inserted.** Write your note somewhere below following the `[^#]: your note here` syntax. For example:

``` markdown
I am going to insert a footnote here[^1].

[^1]: Here is the associated footnote, which will appear at the bottom of my document in a "Footnotes" section.
```

2.  **Alternatively, you can write your notes inline** to avoid having to use identifiers (e.g. `[^#]`). For example:

``` markdown
I am going to insert an inline footnote here^[Here is my inline footnote].
```

3.  **You can also add footnotes that include multiple paragraphs.** See the [source code](https://github.com/samanthacsik/samanthacsik.github.io/blob/main/posts/2022-10-24-quarto-blogs/index.qmd){target="_blank"} for this blog post and take a peek at footnote #2 for an example on how to do so (or check out the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html#footnotes){target="_blank"}).

All footnotes will appear in a "Footnotes" section that is automatically generated for you.

### Creating a bibliography and adding citations

Quarto supports the use of bibliography files for citing works throughout your blog post. There are a number of ways to do this, but so far, I've found creating a BibLaTex database to be relatively straightforward. This database takes the form of a plain-text `.bib` file where we can store all of our bibliographic information. That information needs to be encoded in a particular way (more on that below). Follow these steps to cite works in your blog posts:

1.  **First, create a `.bib` file in the folder containing your blog post.** I called mine `references.bib`, but the name is up to you.

::: panel-tabset
## {{< fa brands r-project title="R programming language icon" >}} RStudio

1.  Ensure that you're in your blog post directory (e.g. `myWebsite/posts/YYYY-MM-DD-my-blog-post/`) in the Files pane
2.  Click on the new **File** button, then select the **Text File** option (this allows you to define any file type)
3.  Type `references.bib` in the name field, then press **OK**

## {{< fa plus title="plus symbol" >}} Positron

1.  From the Explorer menu, click on your blog post directory (e.g. `myWebsite/posts/YYYY-MM-DD-my-blog-post/`) to highlight it
2.  Click the **New File...** button (which appears when you hover your mouse over your repository name), type the name, `references.bib`, then click **Enter / Return**

## {{< fa terminal title="terminal symbol, |>" >}} Terminal

1.  Ensure that you're in your blog post directory (e.g. `myWebsite/posts/YYYY-MM-DD-my-blog-post/`) using `pwd` and `cd` to navigate there, as necessary
2.  Run `touch references.bib` to create your file
:::

2.  **Add the `bibliography` option to your blog post's YAML** and provide it the name of your `.bib` file:

```{r filename="myWebsite/posts/YYYY-MM-DD-my-blog-post/index.qmd"}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false
---
title: "blog post title"
# ~ additional YAML options omitted for brevity ~
bibliography: references.bib
---
```

3.  **Next, we'll want to add some references.** These take a particular format that generally looks like this (the number / types of fields included may vary):

```{r filename="references.bib"}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
@type{key,
  author = {LastName, FirstName},
  title = {Title of work},
  date = {YYYY}
  url = {https://url.com},
  langid = {en}
}
```

where `type` can be `manual`, `book`, `article`, `misc`, etc. (all case-insensitive) and `key` is the citation identifier used for inserting in-text citations (we'll get there soon).

-   There may be instances where you want to cite a resource that already has a BibTex citation available for you to copy over to your `references.bib` file (e.g. this blog post has one available at the bottom). For most resources, however, you'll need to construct your own. You can do this manually, or with the help of a BibTeX reference generator (Googling will yield plenty of options, but [zoterobib](https://zbib.org/){target="_blank"} is a great place to start. Note that you may have to make some manual adjustments). Check out my [`references.bib` file](https://github.com/samanthacsik/samanthacsik.github.io/blob/main/posts/2022-10-24-quarto-blogs/references.bib){target="_blank"} for this post as an example.

4.  **Now that you have BibTex references in your `.bib` file, you can start adding in-text citations.** These generally take the form `[@key]` (but read more about [Quarto citation syntax](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html#sec-citations){target="_blank"}). When you add an in-text citation, Quarto will automatically add the reference to the bottom of your blog post under the "References" section.

-   To give a concrete example, let's say I want to cite [my first (ever) blog post](../2021-09-21-distill-blogs/index.qmd){target="_blank"} from 2021. I can copy the [BibTeX citation from the bottom of the post](../2022-10-24-quarto-blogs/#citation){target="_blank"} and paste it into my `references.bib` file:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
@online{csik2021,
  author = {Samantha Csik},
  title = {Why Create Presentation Slides about Blogging When You Can
    Just Blog about It Instead?},
  date = {2021-09-24},
  url = {https://samanthacsik.github.io/posts/2021-09-21-distill-blogs/},
  langid = {en}
}
```

-   I can now add an in-text citation using the `[@csik2021]` syntax, which will render it like this {{< fa arrow-right title="an arrow pointing to the right" >}} [@csik2021]. Once cited, the full reference will appear in my [References section at the bottom of this post](#references).

5.  **Optionally, you can update your preferred citation style** (the default is set to [Chicago Manual of Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html){target="_blank"}). Search for and download your preferred citation style (in the form of a `.csl` ([Citation Style Language](https://citationstyles.org/)) file) from either [CSL Project](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles){target="_blank"} or [Zotereo's style repository](https://www.zotero.org/styles){target="_blank"}, and add it to your blog post's folder. Update your blog post's YAML using the `csl` option to apply the new styling. For example, I can apply [PLOS Computational Biology styling](https://www.zotero.org/styles?q=plos%20computational%20biology){target="_blank"}:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false
---
title: "blog post title"
# ~ additional YAML options omitted for brevity ~
csl: plos-computational-biology.csl
---
```

That wasn't so bad, right?? **What if I told you there was an even *easier* way to add citations....**

1. Start by popping over to **Visual editor** in either RStudio *or* Positron (yes, this works in both IDEs!). Locate the **Source** and **Visual** editor buttons at the top left corner of your blog post file (`index.qmd`). Click on **Visual** editor button (if you're working in Positron, there are actually a [number of different ways](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/positron/visual-editor.html){target="_blank"} to switch to the Visual editor). Once in Visual editor mode, you should see a tool bar appear at the top of your file.

2.  Place your cursor where you'd like to insert a citation, then from the **Insert** drop down menu (see tool bar), select **Citation**.

3.  A new window will pop open with a number of different options for inserting citations. If you've already created a `references.bib` file, it will appear under the **My Sources** and **Bibliography** sections. You can choose to insert citations using any of your existing references, *or* choose another option, like inserting a citation based on a DOI. Give it a try using [this DOI](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010567){target="_blank"} from Gaynor et al. 2022 -- you'll notice that when an in-text citation is added using a DOI, your `references.bib` file will automatically be updated with the BibTeX reference. If you don't yet have a `.bib` file, one will be automatically generated for you. LIKE SERIOUSLY?? Where was this when I was in grad school?? SO FREAKIN COOL.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: "100%"
#| fig-cap: "Inserting a citation from the Visual editor in RStudio. You should see a near-identical window when using Positron."
knitr::include_graphics("media/citations.png")
```

Okay, back to being chill...

### Article layout

Quarto also supports a number of different [page layout options](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/article-layout.html){target="_blank"} to further customize the appearance of your posts (or any page on your website, for that matter). 
 <!-- Explore different ways to position elements on your page. or include embedded outputs, captions, references, etc. in your [page margin](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/article-layout.html#margin-content){target="_blank"}. -->

## VII. A note on adding an additional blog (or more) to your site {#VII-more-blogs}

You aren't limited to just one blog / listing page! Repeat [Part III](#III-add-blog){target="_blank"} to add a second listing page plus content to your website. My personal website contains *four* listing pages -- one called [posts](../../posts.qmd){target="_blank"} (aka my actual blog), one called [talks & workshops](../../talks_workshops.qmd){target="_blank"}, once called [courses](../../courses.qmd){target="_blank"}, and one called [projects](../../projects.qmd){target="_blank"}. Explore the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/samanthacsik/samanthacsik.github.io){target="_blank"} to take a peek at the file structure and source code.

## VIII. Blogs to follow (+ one post from each that I've particularly enjoyed) {#VIII-follow}

There are *tons* of awesome data science bloggers out there -- here are just a few that I've enjoyed, but get out there and start exploring others for yourself!

***Also note:** I've included one blog post from each creator and added citations (with the year only format). Check out the [source code for this post](https://github.com/samanthacsik/samanthacsik.github.io/blob/main/posts/2022-10-24-quarto-blogs/index.qmd) to see how it's done.*
