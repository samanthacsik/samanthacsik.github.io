However, learning an entirely new programming language can be time prohibitive and unrealistic for many researchers. Lucky for R users, there’s an app (well, R packages) for that!\n\nIn this hands-on live-coding workshop, we’ll explore the {DT}, {plotly}, and {leaflet} packages, which make JavaScript libraries more accessible for R-users looking to infuse their static visualizations with interactivity. Together, we’ll build an interactive table, plot, and map, and demonstrate how these outputs can be shared using open data science communication tools, like RMarkdown and Quarto.\n\n# Audience\n\nThis workshop was developed for and taught during the [SORTEE Workshops and Webinar](https://www.sortee.org/other_events/) series.\n",
