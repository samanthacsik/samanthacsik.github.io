We tried out something new in summer 2023, and instead presented a few \"Keyboard Shortcuts of the Week\" throughout the 6-week long MEDS summer session. Overall, I think this was a much needed change to content delivery! You can read more about the format and shortcuts list on [this wiki](https://github.com/UCSB-MEDS/IDE-tips-and-tricks/wiki/Updated-Approach-for-Delivering-IDE-Tips-&-Tricks---Keyboard-Shortcuts).\n\n<br>\n\n<!-- <center><iframe class=\"slide-deck\" src=\"https://ucsb-meds.github.io/IDE-tips-and-tricks/#/title-slide\" title=\"IDE Tips & Tricks\" width=750px, height=550px></iframe></center> -->\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"shareagain\" style=\"min-width:300px;margin:1em auto;max-width:60%;\" data-exeternal=\"1\">\n<iframe src=\"https://ucsb-meds.github.io/IDE-tips-and-tricks/#/title-slide\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" style=\"border:2px solid currentColor;\" loading=\"lazy\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<script>fitvids('.shareagain', {players: 'iframe'});</script>\n</div>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n::: {.center-text}\n[{{< fa tv title=\"A television screen\" >}} slides](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/IDE-tips-and-tricks/#/title-slide){.btn role=\"button\" target=_blank} [{{< fa brands github title=\"Octocat, the GitHub logo\" >}} source code](https://github.com/UCSB-MEDS/IDE-tips-and-tricks){.btn role=\"button\" target=_blank}\n:::\n\n# Abstract\n\nAs environmental data scientists, we spend a lot of time in RStudio.
