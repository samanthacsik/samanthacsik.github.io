There are lots of great tools for building websites using R (e.g. `{distill}`, `{blogdown}`) -- this year, we'll be using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), an exciting, new, and versatile publishing tool that supports R, Python, Julia, and ObservableJS. Want to get started on building your own website using Quarto? Check out this [tutorial](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/creating-quarto-websites/).\n\n# Audience\n\nThis workshop was originally developed for the [Master of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) program](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/), administered by the [Bren School of Environmental Science & Management](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science) in partnership with the [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/).\n",
