In this workshop, we'll consider a variety of different visualizations and discuss which design elements and decisions most effectively communicate insights and engage audiences. We'll then review some strategies for designing clear and compelling charts, and begin brainstorming ways to visually communicate key insights from your own BEL research projects.\n\n# Audience\n\nThis workshop was originally developed for the the 2025 [Bren Environmental Leadership (BEL) fellows](https://bren.ucsb.edu/undergrad-mentoring/bren-environmental-leadership-bel-program). The BEL program aims to increase the representation of first-generation, low-income, and underrepresented students pursuing careers in the environmental field and natural sciences. As part of the program, undergraduate fellows receive mentorship from graduate students, conduct a summer research project, and participate in professional development workshops and community-building events. [A version](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11uF9ZQadJQBSM7_1ab4RUhMpTJsNp2VpFt2oAfMnbJs/edit?usp=sharing){target=\"_blank\"} of this workshop was given to the undergraduate students in [Max Czapanskiy](https://bren.ucsb.edu/people/max-czapanskiy){target=\"_blank\"}'s Marine Policy course in Fall 2025.\n",
