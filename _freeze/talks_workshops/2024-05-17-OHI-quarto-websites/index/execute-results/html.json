It has been tailored (from itâ€™s [previous version](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/creating-quarto-websites/)) to serve [Ocean Health Index](https://oceanhealthindex.org/) (OHI) [fellows](https://oceanhealthindex.org/about/ohifellows/) in building websites to organize, house, and better share OHI methodology. We walk through the steps of creating the essential building blocks of any Quarto website, configuring website navigation menus, deploying a website (for free) using GitHub Pages, using Sass to update website fonts and colors, and a few other helpful tips and tricks. \n\n# Audience\n\nThis workshop was delivered to the 2024 [Ocean Health Index fellows](https://oceanhealthindex.org/about/ohifellows/), a group of three early-career data scientists who work to calculate the latest OHI scores and improve workflows and methodology (among other exciting and innovative work). They are based at the [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/) from May - September.\n",
