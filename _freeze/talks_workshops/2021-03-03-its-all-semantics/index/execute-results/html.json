However, in order for synthesis science to be possible, data need to be documented and stored in a way that makes them both discoverable and interpretable by researchers. My team at NCEAS is taking a semantic approach to curating environmental datasets -- we develop controlled vocabularies, or ontologies, that we use to annotate data records. This helps to both (a) increase our understanding of the terms researchers have used to describe their data by providing greater meaning and context, and (b) increases the precision of our online data searches so that we more confidently recover all available and relevant datasets.",
