And for new learners in the age of AI, developing strong troubleshooting skills and search strategies is essential for building independence and critical thinking. But learning how to ask the right questions and get useful answers can be tricky, particularly for new programmers. In this presentation, we'll explore practical techniques for refining your searches, diagnosing erors, and increasing your chances at fining helpful, relevant solutions.\n\n# Audience\n\nThis talk was originally developed for the [Master of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) program](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/){target=\"_blank\"}, administered by the [Bren School of Environmental Science & Management](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science){target=\"_blank\"} in partnership with the [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/){target=\"_blank\"}. Previous adapatations for various non-MEDS audiences can be found in a [separate repository](https://samanthacsik.github.io/teach-me-how-to-google/){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n<!-- While it's undergone a series of iterations over the years, the most substantial revamp came in 2025 as the MEDS program Curriculum Cohesion Committee strategized aroudn how to prirotizie foundational data and critical thinking skills early on, and that we also need to offer more support to promote responsible GenAI use as they year progresses. -->\n\n\n",
