But figuring out how to get the information you need back can be incredibly challenging, particularly for new coders. In this workshop, weâ€™ll discuss strategies for refining your queries to increase your chances of finding informative solutions.\n\n# Audience\n\nThis talk was originally developed for the [Master of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) program](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/), administered by the [Bren School of Environmental Science & Management](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science) in partnership with the [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/).\n\nIt's since been adapted for a number of non-MEDS audiences, including students from UCSB's [Master of Technology Management Program](https://tmp.ucsb.edu/academics/master-technology-management) (Jan 2022), [R-Ladies St. Louis](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-st-louis/?_cookie-check=tJVp_VfFF4axweCV) (Feb 2022), [The Brown School StatLab](https://gwbweb.wustl.edu/News/Pages/Brown-School-StatLab-offers-statistics-support.aspx) at the University of Washington in St. Louis (Mar 2022), undergraduate students in [UCSB's Environmental Studies Program](https://samanthacsik.github.io/teach-me-how-to-google/slides/WaterData_2022-11-08.html#1) (Nov 2022 & 2023), and UCSB's [Data Analysis and Coding Club (DAnC)](https://samanthacsik.github.io/teach-me-how-to-google/slides/DAnC-2023-05-17.html#1) (May 2023). Most times, the slides remain unchanged (aside from an updated title slide), but there are minor differences here and there depending on audience needs/experiences.
