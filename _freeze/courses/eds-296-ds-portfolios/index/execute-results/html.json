Learners, collaborators, and future employers alike will look to your public online profiles to glean information about you and your work. As data scientists, this often means that theyâ€™ll head to one of two places: GitHub and / or your personal website. This course is designed to help you both lay the foundation for creating and maintaining these profiles in an organized, informative, and visually-appealing way. Over the next several weeks, you will:\n\n- build and deploy your personal website using popular data science tools and frameworks\n- create your first (of many!) data science blog posts\n- learn about how best to communicate your work to different audiences\n- understand where and how to document your projects and code\n- and more!\n\n<br>\n\n::: {.grid}\n\n::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-md-6}\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](quarto.png){fig-align='center' width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-md-6}\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](github.png){fig-align='center' width=95%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\n<br>\n\n# When is this taught?\n\nThis content has taken a variety of forms since MEDS begain in 2021 -- we initially taught website development using the [`{distill}` package](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/){target=\"_blank\"} in R (see our original [website develoment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c0SZiVvp32UTJ9sK_yVjI8ou6pVdFRXsY2236tiTA1c/edit?tab=t.0){target=\"_blank\"} & [blog](../../posts/2021-09-21-distill-blogs/index.qmd){target=\"_blank\"} workshops).\n\nWhen [Quarto](https://quarto.org/){target=\"_blank\"} burst onto the scene in 2022, we revamped this content and delivered lessons as separate, non-credit-bearing workshops: \n\n- [Creating your personal website using Quarto](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/creating-quarto-websites/){target=\"_blank\"}\n- [Customizing Quarto websites](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/customizing-quarto-websites/#/title-slide){target=\"_blank\"} \n- [Adding a blog to your existing Quarto website](../../posts/2022-10-24-quarto-blogs/index.qmd){target=\"_blank\"}\n\nIn Fall 2024, we combined these workshops into a full 2-unit course, with an additional focus on GitHub as a professional portfolio. While this course was a lot of fun and seemed to work pretty well, conversations with Bren's [Career Services Team](https://bren.ucsb.edu/career-services){target=\"_blank\"} highlighted potential benefits of more consistent messaging and collaboration across all of the MEDS career and professional development teaching efforts. We'll be offering this content as part of our new MEDS Career & Professional Develoment weekly workshop series beginning in Fall 2025. \n\n\n",
