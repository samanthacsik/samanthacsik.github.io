Halina designed and built v1.0 of the public-facing [dashboard](https://shinyapps.bren.ucsb.edu/student-data-explorer/) for exploring these data. \n\nSince then, the proverbial torch was passed to me for continued maintenance and updates. I collaborate with the Bren Admissions and [Career Services](https://bren.ucsb.edu/career-services) Teams, as well as MEDS Program Coordinator, [Jamie Montgomery](https://www.jamiecmontgomery.com/), to update data, modify visuals, and refactor the code, as needed, each year. My most significant contribution so far is the Spring 2025 refactor and development of comprehensive wiki documentation. This rewrite focused on establishing a consistent, organized code structure and workflow, and on clearly documenting a standard operating procedure to support future updates.\n\n<br>\n\n:::: {.grid}\n\n::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-md-6}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](dashboard.png){fig-align='center' width=95%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<!-- <img class=\"center-img\" src=\"dashboard.png\" width=\"70%\"> -->\n\n::: {.gray-italic .center-text}\nThe Career Outcomes page of the Bren Student Data Explorer, accessible at [https://shinyapps.bren.ucsb.edu/student-data-explorer/](https://shinyapps.bren.ucsb.edu/student-data-explorer/){target=\"_blank\"}\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-md-6}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](wiki.png){fig-align='center' width=95%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n<!-- <img class=\"center-img\" src=\"dashboard.png\" width=\"70%\"> -->\n::: {.gray-italic .center-text}\nThe Bren Student Data Explorer [wiki](https://github.com/UCSB-MEDS/shiny-dashboard/wiki){target=\"_blank\"}, which houses documentation and detailed instructions for updating and Maintaining the dashboard\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\n<!-- alt=\"A online dashboard with a banner image depicting the Bren School building with the ocean to the left.
